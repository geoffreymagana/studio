## ‚ú® Prompt for Cursor

Here‚Äôs a ready-to-use instruction for Cursor:

```
Build a romantic, mobile-first anniversary website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only (next.js may be an easy frameworks if html and css and js is not enough). 
The site should be arranged with clean sections and a smooth scrolling experience. 

Features:
1. **Landing Page / Auth**: A cute entry screen with a custom auth (example: enter a secret phrase, like ‚Äúour song‚Äù or ‚Äúour anniversary date‚Äù), then reveal the site. 
2. **Life in Numbers**: Display counters (days known, days loved, special memories). Each number links to a photo + description modal or card. 
3. **Letter Section**: Display a pre-written love letter from me. Add a text box where she can reply. When she clicks send, animate a paper airplane flying off the screen. 
4. **Gallery/Reel**: A horizontal scroll or simple carousel of goofy + special photos. 
5. **Spotify Playlist**: Embed our shared playlist. 
6. **Our Story Timeline**: Vertical timeline with milestones (first meeting, first trip, special days). 
7. **Love Counter Button**: A big cute heart button. Each click increments ‚ÄúTimes I love you‚Äù with animation (hearts float up like TikTok). Persist count with localStorage or inside the mongodb db. 
8. **Distance Widget**: Input two locations (or use static city values). Show distance in km. Allow it to animate decreasing when updated. 
9. **Mobile-friendly UI**: Design for phone-first usage with smooth fonts, spacing, and touch-friendly buttons. 

Branding & Styling Direction:
- Primary color: #a020f0 (purple).
- Accent: pastel pink (#ff9ecf) for highlights and heart animations.
- Background: soft gradient (white ‚Üí light lavender).
- Fonts: Use a handwritten/cursive font for headers (like 'Dancing Script') and a clean sans-serif for body (like 'Poppins').
- Buttons & cards: rounded corners, soft drop shadows, playful hover animations.
- Overall vibe: warm, playful, romantic, modern yet whimsical.

Extra polish:
- Floating heart/confetti particles in background (light + subtle).
- Smooth fade/slide animations when scrolling between sections.
