## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to convey sophistication and love.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E6FA), a gentle hue reminiscent of the primary color.
- Accent color: Coral pink (#FF80AB), analogous to purple on the color wheel, to draw attention to interactive elements without overpowering the composition.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a humanist sans-serif for an elegant touch.
- Body font: 'Alegreya', a serif, for a contemporary reading experience.
- Implement subtle, romantic animations throughout the site (floating hearts, paper airplane). Keep animations short and sweet, but high quality.
